                    <h3>Air Travel</h3>

                    <p>Most visitors arrive on Taniti by air through our island airport. Currently, our facilities
                      accommodate small jets and propeller planes with regular connections from major regional hubs.
                      We're
                      excited to announce an ongoing expansion project that will allow larger jets to land on the island
                      within the next few years, making Taniti even more accessible to international travelers.</p>

                    <h3>Airlines Serving Taniti</h3>

                    <p>Several regional carriers offer regular flights to Taniti with connections through major Pacific
                      hubs. Flight times vary seasonally, with increased frequency during peak tourist months. We
                      recommend booking flights 3-4 months in advance for the best fares, especially if traveling during
                      holiday periods.</p>

                    <h3>Cruise Ship Arrivals</h3>

                    <p>Taniti welcomes a small cruise ship that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per week. This
                      provides a brief but enchanting introduction to our island. Cruise passengers often return for
                      longer stays after getting a taste of Taniti's natural beauty and warm hospitality. The ship
                      typically arrives Wednesday morning and departs Thursday afternoon, allowing passengers a full day
                      to explore Taniti City and nearby attractions.</p>

                    <h3>Entry Requirements</h3>

                    <p>Visitors to Taniti must have a valid passport with at least six months remaining before
                      expiration.
                      Most nationalities receive a 30-day tourist visa upon arrival at no charge. Travelers planning
                      extended stays should contact the Tanitian Embassy or Consulate in their home country for
                      information about longer-term visas.</p>

                    <h3>Customs & Immigration</h3>

                    <p>Upon arrival, visitors will proceed through our streamlined immigration and customs process.
                      Fresh
                      fruits, vegetables, and certain animal products are prohibited from entering the island to protect
                      our delicate ecosystem. Prescription medications are permitted for personal use but should be
                      carried in their original labeled containers.</p>

                      p.m. These air-conditioned buses follow regular routes throughout the city with stops at major

                      throughout
                      the island. These comfortable coaches run on scheduled routes with less frequency than city
                      buses
                      but provide access to remote beaches, the volcano, and rainforest trailheads. Schedules are
                      available at your hotel and the main tourism office in Taniti City.</p>

                    <h3>Taxi Services</h3>

                    <p>Taxis are readily available in Taniti City and can be flagged down on main streets or called
                      for
                      pick-up. All official taxis are blue with a yellow stripe and display their registration
                      number
                      prominently. Fares are regulated, with trips within Taniti City typically costing $5-15 USD.
                      For
                      longer journeys, we recommend agreeing on the fare before departing.</p>

                    <h3>Rental Vehicles</h3>

                    <p>A local rental agency near the airport offers a fleet of well-maintained cars suitable for
                      exploring the island at your own pace. Daily rates range from $45-75 USD depending on the
                      vehicle
                      type. An international driver's license is not required, but renters must be at least 21 years
                      old
                      with a valid driver's license from their home country. Remember that we drive on the right
                      side of
                      the road in Taniti.</p>

                    <h3>Bicycle Rentals</h3>

                    <p>Experience Taniti at a leisurely pace by renting a bicycle from several vendors in Taniti
                      City
                      and
                      Merriton Landing. Hourly, daily, and weekly rates are available, with all rentals including
                      required
                      safety helmets (mandatory by law). Taniti City's flat terrain makes cycling an enjoyable and
                      environmentally friendly way to explore urban areas. The coastal road offers spectacular ocean
                      views
                      for more adventurous cyclists.</p>

                    <h3>Walking</h3>

                    <p>Taniti City and the Merriton Landing area are both pleasantly walkable, with wide sidewalks
                      and
                      pedestrian zones. A picturesque waterfront promenade connects many popular destinations,
                      making
                      walking both practical and enjoyable. For safety, we recommend carrying water, wearing sun
                      protection, and using marked crosswalks when navigating the city on foot.</p>
